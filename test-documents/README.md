## Testing Notes

### Content Variations
Each document includes different writing issues that should trigger suggestions:
- **Passive voice usage** (for business and academic documents)
- **Weak transitions** (for essays and general writing)
- **Dialogue formatting** (for scripts and creative writing)
- **Technical jargon** (for academic and business documents)
- **Informal language** (in professional contexts)

### Expected Behavior
- Suggestions should be contextually appropriate for each document type
- Creative writing should NOT receive business writing suggestions
- Academic papers should get citation and methodology suggestions
- Scripts should receive formatting and dialogue suggestions
- Emails should focus on clarity and professional communication

### Suggestion Categories
The AI should identify the document type and provide suggestions from the appropriate category pool:
- Document-specific categories (e.g., "thesis-development" for essays)
- General categories that apply to all types (e.g., "clarity-improvement")
- Contextually relevant suggestions based on content analysis

## Troubleshooting

If you're not seeing document-specific suggestions:
1. Verify the document type is set correctly in the editor
2. Check that the Firebase functions are deployed with the latest updates
3. Ensure the document content is substantial enough to trigger analysis
4. Look for suggestions in both the sidebar and inline popover

## Adding New Test Documents

When adding new test documents:
1. Create a file with the format `[document-type]-example.md`
2. Include content that would naturally trigger that document type's specific suggestions
3. Add common writing issues that the AI should catch
4. Update this README with the new document's testing purpose

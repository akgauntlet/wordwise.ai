# THE INTERVIEW
## A Short Film Script

**FADE IN:**

**INT. CORPORATE OFFICE - DAY**

*A sterile conference room with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the city. MARCUS CHEN (28), nervous but determined, sits across from DIANE WINTERS (45), a sharp-eyed HR director.*

**DIANE**  
(reviewing his resume)  
So, Marcus, tell me why you want to work for Innovate Corp.

**MARCUS**  
(fidgeting with his tie)  
Well, I've always been passionate about innovation, and your company's commitment to sustainable technology really speaks to me.

**DIANE**  
(looking up sharply)  
That's what everyone says. What makes you different?

*Marcus pauses, takes a deep breath.*

**MARCUS**  
(more confident)  
Three months ago, I was living in my car. I lost my job, my apartment, everything. But instead of giving up, I spent those nights in parking lots teaching myself coding by the dome light.

*Diane's expression softens slightly.*

**DIANE**  
(leaning forward)  
And?

**MARCUS**  
I built an app that helps homeless individuals find safe places to sleep and access resources. It's been downloaded over 10,000 times.

*Long pause. Diane closes the resume.*

**DIANE**  
(standing)  
When can you start?

**FADE OUT.**

**THE END**

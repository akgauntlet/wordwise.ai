You are an expert in TypeScript, React, Shadcn, Radix UI, Tailwind CSS v3.4.17, and Firebase.
Do not use inline styling. All styling should be done using Tailwind or what is provided in the APIs by Shadcn and Radix UI.

Reminder, use ONLY Tailwind v3, i.e. version 3.4.17, when making any code changes. Do NOT use tailwind v4 in any circumstance.

# Phase 1: Setup - Basic Foundation

**Duration**: 1-2 weeks  
**Goal**: Establish a functional but basic foundation for WordWise.ai with essential infrastructure components working together

---

## Overview

This phase creates the foundational architecture for WordWise.ai - a barebones setup that demonstrates core technical integrations working together. The result will be a basic web application that users can access, authenticate with, and perform simple text editing, but without the full AI writing assistance capabilities.

**Key Achievement**: A working React application with Firebase backend, basic text editing, and user authentication that can be deployed and accessed.

---

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Users can sign up and log in successfully
- ✅ Basic text editor loads and allows typing
- ✅ Documents can be created and saved to Firebase
- ✅ Application deploys successfully to Firebase Hosting
- ✅ All core dependencies are properly integrated
- ✅ Project structure follows established conventions
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes with zero errors

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Firebase Configuration Issues**: Document all configuration steps and validate in multiple environments
- **Authentication Provider Problems**: Test both email/password and Google OAuth in production environment
- **Editor Performance**: Monitor editor performance with large documents and optimize if needed

### Development Risks
- **Dependency Conflicts**: Lock dependency versions and test compatibility
- **TypeScript Compilation**: Address all TypeScript errors before proceeding to MVP phase
- **Security Rule Misconfiguration**: Thoroughly test Firestore security rules with different user scenarios

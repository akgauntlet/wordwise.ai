## Best Practices, Limitations & Conventions

### React + TypeScript

#### Best Practices
- **Component Structure**: Use functional components with hooks over class components
- **Props Interface**: Always define explicit interfaces for component props
- **State Management**: Use `useState` for local state, Context API for shared state, avoid prop drilling
- **Error Boundaries**: Implement error boundaries to catch and handle component errors gracefully
- **Memoization**: Use `React.memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback` for performance optimization
- **Custom Hooks**: Extract reusable logic into custom hooks for better code organization
- **Strict Mode**: Always wrap app in `React.StrictMode` for development warnings

#### Conventions
- **File Naming**: Use PascalCase for components (`DocumentEditor.tsx`), camelCase for utilities
- **Import Order**: External libraries → Internal components → Utilities → Types
- **Component Exports**: Use named exports for components, default exports for pages
- **Hook Naming**: Prefix custom hooks with `use` (`useAutoSave`, `useAIAnalysis`)

#### Common Pitfalls
- **Unnecessary Re-renders**: Avoid creating objects/functions inside render methods
- **Memory Leaks**: Always clean up subscriptions, timers, and event listeners in `useEffect` cleanup
- **State Mutations**: Never mutate state directly, always use state setters
- **Async Effects**: Handle cleanup properly in async `useEffect` hooks
- **Key Props**: Always provide stable, unique keys for list items

#### Limitations
- **Bundle Size**: React adds ~45KB to bundle size
- **Learning Curve**: Hooks and concurrent features require mental model shifts
- **Performance**: Virtual DOM has overhead for simple applications
- **SEO**: Client-side rendering requires additional setup for SEO

### Shadcn/ui + Radix UI

#### Best Practices
- **Accessibility First**: Always test with screen readers and keyboard navigation
- **Customization**: Use CSS variables for theming rather than hardcoded values
- **Composition**: Compose complex components from Radix primitives
- **Consistent Styling**: Establish design tokens early and use consistently
- **Form Validation**: Combine with React Hook Form for robust form handling

#### Conventions
- **Import Structure**: Import Radix primitives and Shadcn components separately
- **Component Naming**: Follow Shadcn naming conventions for consistency
- **Theme Configuration**: Use Tailwind config for consistent color schemes
- **Accessibility**: Always include proper ARIA labels and descriptions

#### Common Pitfalls
- **Styling Conflicts**: Shadcn styles may conflict with custom Tailwind classes
- **Bundle Size**: Including all Radix primitives increases bundle size
- **Customization Complexity**: Deep customization may require understanding Radix internals
- **Server-Side Rendering**: Some components may have hydration issues

#### Limitations
- **Design Flexibility**: Pre-built components may not fit all design requirements
- **Learning Curve**: Understanding Radix's compound component patterns
- **Documentation**: Some advanced use cases lack comprehensive documentation
- **Browser Support**: Limited support for older browsers

### Tailwind CSS v3.4.17

#### Best Practices
- **Utility Classes**: Prefer utility classes over custom CSS
- **Component Classes**: Use `@apply` directive for reusable component styles
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with responsive prefixes
- **Purging**: Configure purging to remove unused styles in production
- **Design System**: Define custom colors, spacing, and typography in config

#### Conventions
- **Class Order**: Layout → Positioning → Sizing → Spacing → Typography → Colors → Effects
- **Responsive Prefixes**: `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, `xl:`, `2xl:` for breakpoints
- **State Variants**: `hover:`, `focus:`, `active:`, `disabled:` for interactive states
- **Custom Properties**: Use CSS custom properties for dynamic values

#### Common Pitfalls
- **Class Name Bloat**: Long class strings reduce readability
- **Specificity Issues**: Utility classes have high specificity
- **Development vs Production**: Ensure purging doesn't remove needed classes
- **Team Consistency**: Without guidelines, teams may use inconsistent approaches

#### Limitations
- **Learning Curve**: Requires memorizing utility class names
- **HTML Verbosity**: Many utility classes make HTML verbose
- **Design Constraints**: May limit creative design solutions
- **Bundle Size**: Full Tailwind CSS is large without proper purging

### Firebase Ecosystem

#### Best Practices

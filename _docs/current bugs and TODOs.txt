the ui does not immediately respond to closing the google signin popup (might be CORS-related?)

when logging in with wrong credentials, should return a message saying something informative instead of "an unexpected error occurred"



version card should have a button that just opens the version in the editor  without creating a new document/version in the database


api response takes way too long (standard?)
